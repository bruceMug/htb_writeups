This is my first writeup for a challenge

The challenge title is Illumination and the description says ```A Junior Developer just switched to a new source control platform. Can you find the secret token?```
No connection to server required to complete the challenge

Solution
I downloaded the necessary files by clicking on ```Download Files``` and a zip file title ```Illumination.js``` was downloaded.

Unzip the files and it containes the following three files i.e config.json, bot.js and .git folder
I started by inspecting the bot.js but nothing of value was found

Then I inspected the config.json file, It contains a base64 string. I used the command 'echo {string} | base64 --decode ``` to decode the string which read 
""Red Herring, read the JS carefully"". When I first read the output, I inspected the JS over and over again inorder to find a clue. I even tried to run the 
file locally but all was in vain.
After a great thought, I tried finding the meaning of "Red Herring" as it means ```a clue or piece of information that is, or is intended to be, misleading or distracting.```
This added salt to the wound and I spent even more time with the js file.

After a little more time, I tried to inspect the .git folder. I tried to use ```grep -r 'token' ``` but go nothing.
Then I tried ```git log``` and something interesting showed up; a commit that was made.
I further went ahead to inspect the specific commit using its ID using ```git show {id}``` and I got a base64 string

and on decoding; boom I got the flag
