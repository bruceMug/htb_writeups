This is my first writeup for a challenge

The challenge title is Illumination and the description says ```A Junior Developer just switched to a new source control platform. Can you find the secret token?```
No connection to server required to complete the challenge

Solution
I downloaded the necessary files by clicking on ```Download Files``` and a zip file title ```Illumination.js``` was downloaded.

Unzip the files and it containes the following three files i.e config.json, bot.js and .git folder
I started by inspecting the bot.js but nothing of value was found

Then I inspected the config.json file, It contains a base64 string. I used the command 'echo {string} | base64 --decode ``` to decode the string which read 
""Red Herring, read the JS carefully"". When I first read the output, I inspected the JS over and over again inorder to find a clue. I even tried to run the 
file locally but all was in vain.
After a great thought, I tried finding the meaning of "Red Herring",
